     * Parsing Text files
     *  -> Often want to convert from text format into java objects
     *  -> Text data comes into our program in the form of strings.
     *  -> We often need to:
     *        - Find delimiters (markers used as boundaries between fields)
     *        - Split strings across delimiters
     *        - Convert strings to other primitive types
     *        - Construct new objects based on paramaters read from the file
     * Some useful methods:
     * -> String.split(String regex) - splits a string into an array of strings
     * -> String.substring(int start, int end) - returns a substring of the string
     * -> String.indexOf(String str) - returns the index of the first occurrence of str in the string
     *
     * Regular expressions:
     * -> Powerful tool to search within a string
     * -> Patterns are defined that describe the search term
     *              -Sequence of charactes describing what to look for
     * -> Not covered in this course
     *
     * Converting strings to other types:
     * -> Integer.parseInt(String s) - converts a string to an int
     * -> Double.parseDouble(String s) - converts a string to a double
     * -> Boolean.parseBoolean(String s) - converts a string to a boolean
     * -> Float.parseFloat(String s) - converts a string to a float
     *
     * Number conversions throw a NumberFormatException if the string doesn't contain a valid number
     * Boolean conversion returns false if the string is not "true" (ignoring case)
     *
     * From text data to objects:
     * Different access can be used for constructing objects from I/O
     * 1. Constructor takes filename/reader as a parameter
     *        Good: Easy to use, Constructor has access to private members
     *        Bad: Class now has to deal with I/O exceptions
     * 2. Static method in the same class
     *       -> Same as above, except can also return null if something goes wrong
     * 3. static method in a different class
     *        Good: Provides "loose" coupling of class with I/O classes
     *              New classes/methods can be used to add formats
     *        Bad: No access to private members
     *             Needs access to constructors
